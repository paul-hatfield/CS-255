# CS-255
System Analysis and Design

Liam is the owner of DriverPass.
Liam noticed a large number of people that did not pass their driving test
on the first attempt and thought that better instruction would help.

After the interview with the DriverPass team we concluded that DriverPass needed a web based application
By having clients purchase one of three packages through the web app,
the customers would have the ability to schedule or cancel in-person driving instruction, monitor their progress 
and take practice exams include the most current DMV rules and regulations.

I would have liked to spend more time designing the UML diagrams. This was a time consuming task.

I enjoyed CS-255 and Professor Eppenger was a great motivator.
